## About

This project provides readonly access to IPAM (IP address management) data,
based on the static site generator Jekyll and JavaScript.

For IPAM Web, the primary design goal was to provide a web UI for accessing
Microsoft IPAM, which is available via the server management console, only.
Keeping that in mind, the design of this project mostly fits the needs for that
specific IPAM. However, any other IPAM is supported, as long as its data can be
transformed into the defined [API model](#API) of this project.


## Usage

1. Build the contents of this project. If a GitLab instance is available, this
   project simply can be forked into the local instance and assets will be
   generated by the CI automatically. For manual builds, see the
   [configuration of GitLab CI](.gitlab-ci.yml) for instructions.

   *NOTE: If IPAM Web will reside in a subdirectory (e.g. for GitLab Pages),path
   needs to be set accordingly. For GitLab CI, the `IPAM_BASE_URL` variable can
   be set.*

1. Generate IPAM data according to the [API specifications](#API). For some IPAM
   systems scripts can be found in the [bin folder](bin). See their contents for
   usage information.

1. Place the full contents in a designated webspace.


## API

Data displayed by IPAM Web is stored in plain JSON files. Therefore, these can
be used by other systems like any other API. These files are:

|File|Description|
|-|-|
|`/api/[v4\|v6]/block.json` |IP blocks|
|`/api/[v4\|v6]/subnet.json`|IP subnets|
|`/api/[v4\|v6]/ranges.json`|IP ranges|
|`/api/[v4\|v6]/ip.json`    |IP addresses|
|`/api/update`              |Timestamp of last API update (ISO-8601)|

The specification of each data file can be found in the related
[API description file](_data/api).
