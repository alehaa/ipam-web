/**
 * Size of the stretchbox.
 *
 * Content of the stretchbox should be visually centered on the page. Therefore,
 * its size should be 100% viewport height excluding top and bottom margins for
 * header / footer.
 *
 * NOTE: As 'real center' doesn't seem to be nice for eyes, the content will be
 *       placed slightly above by simply multiplying the excess spaces by three
 *       instead of two.
 *
 * NOTE: This solution only works for pages with a larger header than footer, or
 *       the strechbox will exceed its valid space and the page will have a
 *       scrollbar even on almost empty pages.
