/**
 * Size of the stretchbox.
 *
 * Content of the stretchbox should be visually centered on the page. Therefore,
 * its size should be 100% viewport height excluding top and bottom margins for
 * header / footer.
 *
 * To really center the content, the header size will be multiplied by two, to
 * ensure the following stretchbox really will have its center in the center of
 * the viewport.
 *
 * NOTE: This solution only works for pages with a larger header than footer, or
 *       the strechbox will exceed its valid space and the page will have a
 *       scrollbar even on almost empty pages.
